The unpaired mean difference between AON_Dp2Yey and AON_WT is 72.2 [95%CI -1.7e+02, 3.4e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.619. 

The unpaired mean difference between DP_Dp2Yey and DP_WT is -2.46e+02 [95%CI -5.87e+02, 5.99].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.162. 

The unpaired mean difference between PIR_Dp2Yey and PIR_WT is 1.14e+02 [95%CI -2.05e+02, 4.52e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.546. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
