The unpaired mean difference between ACAd1_Dp2Yey and ACAd1_WT is 58.7 [95%CI -2.72e+02, 5.53e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.812. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd2/3_Dp2Yey and ACAd2/3_WT is 1.87e+02 [95%CI -1.65e+02, 8.62e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.569. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd5_Dp2Yey and ACAd5_WT is -1.23e+02 [95%CI -6.67e+02, 5.67e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.74. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd6a_Dp2Yey and ACAd6a_WT is 42.9 [95%CI -1.22e+03, 1.32e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.942. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
