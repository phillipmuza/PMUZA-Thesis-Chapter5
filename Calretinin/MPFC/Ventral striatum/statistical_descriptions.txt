The unpaired mean difference between ACB_Dp2Yey and ACB_WT is 2.17 [95%CI -84.7, 98.5].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.979. 

The unpaired mean difference between OT_Dp2Yey and OT_WT is -3.73e+02 [95%CI -8.12e+02, 1.23e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.202. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
