The unpaired mean difference between TTd_Dp2Yey and TTd_WT is -27.8 [95%CI -6.46e+02, 5.11e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.97. 

The unpaired mean difference between TTv_Dp2Yey and TTv_WT is 1.35e+02 [95%CI -2.96e+02, 5.94e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.585. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
