The unpaired mean difference between ILA1_Dp2Yey and ILA1_WT is -4.41e+02 [95%CI -1.36e+03, 80.8].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.33. 

The unpaired mean difference between ILA2/3_Dp2Yey and ILA2/3_WT is -7.44e+02 [95%CI -2.46e+03, 61.8].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.431. 

The unpaired mean difference between ILA5_Dp2Yey and ILA5_WT is -2.23e+02 [95%CI -6.64e+02, 2.17e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.387. 

The unpaired mean difference between ILA6a_Dp2Yey and ILA6a_WT is -1.45e+02 [95%CI -7.31e+02, 5.39e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.738. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
