The unpaired mean difference between ORBl2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBl2/3_WT is 2.54e+02 [95%CI -47.7, 5.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.162. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl5_Dp2Yey and ORBl5_WT is 1.2e+02 [95%CI -2e+02, 4.23e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.488. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6a_Dp2Yey and ORBl6a_WT is 61.6 [95%CI -1.65e+02, 2.7e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.615. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6b_Dp2Yey and ORBl6b_WT is -91.4 [95%CI -7.75e+02, 6.22e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.797. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
