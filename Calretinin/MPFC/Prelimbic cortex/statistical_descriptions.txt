The unpaired mean difference between PL1_Dp2Yey and PL1_WT is -3.34e+02 [95%CI -8.15e+02, -10.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.176. 

The unpaired mean difference between PL2/3_Dp2Yey and PL2/3_WT is -2.13e+02 [95%CI -6.14e+02, 2.33e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.37. 

The unpaired mean difference between PL5_Dp2Yey and PL5_WT is 3.47e+02 [95%CI -3.15e+02, 8.94e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.305. 

The unpaired mean difference between PL6a_Dp2Yey and PL6a_WT is 8.4e+02 [95%CI -85.8, 1.69e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.126. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
