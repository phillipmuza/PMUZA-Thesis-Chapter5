The unpaired mean difference between MOp1_Dp2Yey and MOp1_WT is 15.4 [95%CI -2.47e+02, 2.39e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.902. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp2/3_Dp2Yey and MOp2/3_WT is 1.29e+02 [95%CI -2.37e+02, 4.02e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.508. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp5_Dp2Yey and MOp5_WT is 3.79e+02 [95%CI 8.67, 7.49e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0746. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp6a_Dp2Yey and MOp6a_WT is 1.4e+02 [95%CI 25.3, 2.89e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.126. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
