The unpaired mean difference between AIv1_Dp2Yey and AIv1_WT is 1.51e+02 [95%CI -3.34e+02, 6.35e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.569. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv2/3_Dp2Yey and AIv2/3_WT is 20.8 [95%CI -4.16e+02, 3.9e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.928. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv5_Dp2Yey and AIv5_WT is 1.29e+02 [95%CI -1.31e+02, 4.66e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.466. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
