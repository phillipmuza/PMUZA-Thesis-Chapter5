The unpaired mean difference between ORBm1_Dp2Yey and ORBm1_WT is -3.85e+02 [95%CI -1.35e+03, 4.08e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.447. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBm2/3_WT is 6.71e+02 [95%CI -5.11, 1.25e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.195. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm5_Dp2Yey and ORBm5_WT is 7.73e+02 [95%CI 1.75e+02, 1.38e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0582. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm6a_Dp2Yey and ORBm6a_WT is -5.83 [95%CI -6.35e+02, 5.72e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.986. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
