The unpaired mean difference between AId1_Dp2Yey and AId1_WT is 1.68e+02 [95%CI -2.63e+02, 6.15e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.498. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId2/3_Dp2Yey and AId2/3_WT is 5.05e+02 [95%CI -48.8, 1.2e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.16. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId5_Dp2Yey and AId5_WT is 1.45e+02 [95%CI -1.8e+02, 4.69e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.435. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId6a_Dp2Yey and AId6a_WT is 68.4 [95%CI -84.0, 2.15e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.421. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
