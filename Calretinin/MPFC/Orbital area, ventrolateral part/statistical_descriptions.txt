The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBvl2/3_WT is -3.15e+02 [95%CI -8.88e+02, 4.33e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.525. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl5_Dp2Yey and ORBvl5_WT is 6.31e+02 [95%CI 62.4, 1.22e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0694. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl6a_Dp2Yey and ORBvl6a_WT is -1.77e+02 [95%CI -9.59e+02, 4.3e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.661. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
