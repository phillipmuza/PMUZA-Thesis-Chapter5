The unpaired mean difference between PERI1_Dp2Yey and PERI1_WT is -2.13e+02 [95%CI -1.1e+03, 7.01e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.676. 

The unpaired mean difference between PERI2/3_Dp2Yey and PERI2/3_WT is 7.11e+02 [95%CI 1.93e+02, 1.19e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0378. 

The unpaired mean difference between PERI5_Dp2Yey and PERI5_WT is -6.38e+02 [95%CI -1.18e+03, -91.3].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.113. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
