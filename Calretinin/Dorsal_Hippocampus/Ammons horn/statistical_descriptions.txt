The unpaired mean difference between CA1_Dp2Yey and CA1_WT is 3.4e+02 [95%CI -11.4, 6.21e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.091. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA2_Dp2Yey and CA2_WT is 2.18e+02 [95%CI -3.27e+02, 5.11e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.36. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA3_Dp2Yey and CA3_WT is 1.45e+02 [95%CI -3.11e+02, 3.35e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.417. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
