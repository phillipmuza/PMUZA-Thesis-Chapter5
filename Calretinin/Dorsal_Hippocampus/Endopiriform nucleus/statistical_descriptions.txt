The unpaired mean difference between EPd_Dp2Yey and EPd_WT is -1.77e+02 [95%CI -5.33e+02, 2.17e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.426. 

The unpaired mean difference between EPv_Dp2Yey and EPv_WT is -3.65e+02 [95%CI -7.74e+02, 38.7].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.133. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
