Good afternoon!
The current time is Mon Aug 22 17:19:25 2022.

The unpaired mean difference between fiber tracts_Dp2Yey and fiber tracts_WT is -88.3 [95%CI -3.34e+02, 1.54e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.507. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
