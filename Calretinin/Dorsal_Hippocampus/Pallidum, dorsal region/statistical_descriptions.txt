The unpaired mean difference between GPe_Dp2Yey and GPe_WT is -52.5 [95%CI -5.02e+02, 3.81e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.84. 

The unpaired mean difference between GPi_Dp2Yey and GPi_WT is -54.4 [95%CI -4.22e+02, 4.31e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.812. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
