The unpaired mean difference between CL_Dp2Yey and CL_WT is -1.65e+02 [95%CI -3.98e+02, 1.56e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.306. 

The unpaired mean difference between CM_Dp2Yey and CM_WT is -93.6 [95%CI -1.36e+03, 1.75e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.92. 

The unpaired mean difference between PCN_Dp2Yey and PCN_WT is -2e+02 [95%CI -5.46e+02, 1.68e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.335. 

The unpaired mean difference between PIL_Dp2Yey and PIL_WT is 6.5e+02 [95%CI 1.85e+02, 1.54e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0818. 

The unpaired mean difference between RH_Dp2Yey and RH_WT is 1.13e+03 [95%CI -5.49e+02, 2.69e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.246. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
