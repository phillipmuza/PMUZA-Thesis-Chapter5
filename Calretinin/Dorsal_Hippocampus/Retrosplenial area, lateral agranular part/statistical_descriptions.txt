The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl5_Dp2Yey and RSPagl5_WT is -2.79e+02 [95%CI -6.9e+02, 4.27e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.37. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl6a_Dp2Yey and RSPagl6a_WT is -2.63e+02 [95%CI -1.02e+03, 1.09e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.634. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl6b_Dp2Yey and RSPagl6b_WT is -4.5e+02 [95%CI -1.59e+03, 7.7e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.541. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
