The unpaired mean difference between PAL_Dp2Yey and PAL_WT is 1.26e+02 [95%CI -91.6, 3.14e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.275. 

The unpaired mean difference between STR_Dp2Yey and STR_WT is -1.79e+02 [95%CI -5.28e+02, 1.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.35. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
