The unpaired mean difference between DG-mo_Dp2Yey and DG-mo_WT is 3.63e+02 [95%CI 75.5, 6e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.025. 

The unpaired mean difference between DG-po_Dp2Yey and DG-po_WT is 2.76e+02 [95%CI -1.16e+02, 5.01e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.117. 

The unpaired mean difference between DG-sg_Dp2Yey and DG-sg_WT is 3.18e+02 [95%CI 58.4, 5.49e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0446. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
