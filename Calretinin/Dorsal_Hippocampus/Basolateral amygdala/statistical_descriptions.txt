The unpaired mean difference between BLAa_Dp2Yey and BLAa_WT is 1.5e+02 [95%CI -2.48e+02, 5.67e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.496. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAp_Dp2Yey and BLAp_WT is 0.227 [95%CI -6.43e+02, 7.08e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.996. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAv_Dp2Yey and BLAv_WT is -1.12e+02 [95%CI -4.14e+02, 2.57e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.541. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
