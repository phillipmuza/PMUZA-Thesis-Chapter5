The unpaired mean difference between IA_Dp2Yey and IA_WT is 3.27e+02 [95%CI -1.24e+02, 6.77e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.171. 

The unpaired mean difference between MEA_Dp2Yey and MEA_WT is -42.7 [95%CI -2.25e+02, 2.9e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.756. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
