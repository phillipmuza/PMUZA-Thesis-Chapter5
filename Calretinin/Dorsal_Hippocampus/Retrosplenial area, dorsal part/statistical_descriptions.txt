The unpaired mean difference between RSPd5_Dp2Yey and RSPd5_WT is -8.82e+02 [95%CI -1.7e+03, -1.22e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.031. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd6a_Dp2Yey and RSPd6a_WT is -9.25e+02 [95%CI -1.73e+03, -1.87e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0548. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd6b_Dp2Yey and RSPd6b_WT is 4.58e+02 [95%CI -1.46e+03, 2.37e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.514. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
