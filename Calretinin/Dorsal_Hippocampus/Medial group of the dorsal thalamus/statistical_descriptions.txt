The unpaired mean difference between IMD_Dp2Yey and IMD_WT is -1.12e+03 [95%CI -2.6e+03, -67.5].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.131. 

The unpaired mean difference between MD_Dp2Yey and MD_WT is -1.53e+02 [95%CI -8.72e+02, 3.26e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.619. 

The unpaired mean difference between PR_Dp2Yey and PR_WT is 1.8e+02 [95%CI -3.14e+02, 6.67e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.515. 

The unpaired mean difference between SMT_Dp2Yey and SMT_WT is 2.41e+02 [95%CI -3.24e+02, 1.08e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.549. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
