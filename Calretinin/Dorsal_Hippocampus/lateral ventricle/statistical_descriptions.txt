The unpaired mean difference between chpl_Dp2Yey and chpl_WT is 2.81e+02 [95%CI -9.13e+02, 9.18e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.602. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
