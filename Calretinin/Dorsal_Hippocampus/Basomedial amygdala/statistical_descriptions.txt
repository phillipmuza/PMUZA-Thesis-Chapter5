The unpaired mean difference between BMAa_Dp2Yey and BMAa_WT is 1.09e+02 [95%CI -2.23e+02, 5.28e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.616. 

The unpaired mean difference between BMAp_Dp2Yey and BMAp_WT is 74.4 [95%CI -4.06e+02, 5.33e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.791. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
