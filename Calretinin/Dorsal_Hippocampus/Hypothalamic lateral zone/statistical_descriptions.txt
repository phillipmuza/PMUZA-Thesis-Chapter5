The unpaired mean difference between LHA_Dp2Yey and LHA_WT is 29.5 [95%CI -2.03e+02, 2.96e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.849. 

The unpaired mean difference between PSTN_Dp2Yey and PSTN_WT is 3.27e+02 [95%CI -2.33e+02, 7.06e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.333. 

The unpaired mean difference between PST_Dp2Yey and PST_WT is -4.14e+02 [95%CI -8.49e+02, 1.5e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.166. 

The unpaired mean difference between STN_Dp2Yey and STN_WT is -2.35e+02 [95%CI -5.4e+02, 56.2].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.199. 

The unpaired mean difference between TU_Dp2Yey and TU_WT is 43.0 [95%CI -2.93e+02, 3.86e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.818. 

The unpaired mean difference between ZI_Dp2Yey and ZI_WT is -1.09e+02 [95%CI -6.47e+02, 2.45e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.687. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
