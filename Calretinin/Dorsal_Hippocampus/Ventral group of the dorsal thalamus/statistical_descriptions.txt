The unpaired mean difference between VAL_Dp2Yey and VAL_WT is -3.3e+02 [95%CI -9.97e+02, 4.63e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.43. 

The unpaired mean difference between VM_Dp2Yey and VM_WT is 94.4 [95%CI -1.71e+02, 3.38e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.526. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
