The unpaired mean difference between CEAc_Dp2Yey and CEAc_WT is 4.1e+02 [95%CI 49.4, 7.57e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.072. 

The unpaired mean difference between CEAl_Dp2Yey and CEAl_WT is 1.72e+02 [95%CI -3.76e+02, 5.54e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.52. 

The unpaired mean difference between CEAm_Dp2Yey and CEAm_WT is 2.17e+02 [95%CI -1.92e+02, 8.99e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.533. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
