The unpaired mean difference between V3_Dp2Yey and V3_WT is 1.05e+02 [95%CI -6.82e+02, 6.41e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.786. 

The unpaired mean difference between VL_Dp2Yey and VL_WT is -1.42e+02 [95%CI -1.06e+03, 3.47e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.804. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
