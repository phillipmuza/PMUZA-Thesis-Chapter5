The unpaired mean difference between PVT_Dp2Yey and PVT_WT is -2.6e+02 [95%CI -1.18e+03, 4.96e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.578. 

The unpaired mean difference between RE_Dp2Yey and RE_WT is 9.86e+02 [95%CI 4.22e+02, 2.03e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0222. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
