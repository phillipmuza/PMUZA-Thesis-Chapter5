The unpaired mean difference between HY_Dp2Yey and HY_WT is 49.7 [95%CI -2.77e+02, 3.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.746. 

The unpaired mean difference between TH_Dp2Yey and TH_WT is 2.2e+02 [95%CI -2.95e+02, 6.85e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.422. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
