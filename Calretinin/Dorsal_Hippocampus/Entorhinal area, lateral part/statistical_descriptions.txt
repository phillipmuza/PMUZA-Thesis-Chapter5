The unpaired mean difference between ENTl1_Dp2Yey and ENTl1_WT is -3.08e+02 [95%CI -1.54e+03, 9.87e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.653. 

The unpaired mean difference between ENTl2_Dp2Yey and ENTl2_WT is -26.2 [95%CI -1.09e+03, 9e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.95. 

The unpaired mean difference between ENTl3_Dp2Yey and ENTl3_WT is 1.52e+03 [95%CI 6.98e+02, 2.49e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.044. 

The unpaired mean difference between ENTl5_Dp2Yey and ENTl5_WT is 9.43 [95%CI -5.36e+02, 5.58e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.971. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
