The unpaired mean difference between ccs_Dp2Yey and ccs_WT is -67.7 [95%CI -3.64e+02, 2.2e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.674. 

The unpaired mean difference between ee_Dp2Yey and ee_WT is -1.87e+02 [95%CI -8.51e+02, 2.63e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.598. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
