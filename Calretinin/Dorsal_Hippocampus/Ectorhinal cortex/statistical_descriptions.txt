The unpaired mean difference between ECT1_Dp2Yey and ECT1_WT is -7.21e+02 [95%CI -1.53e+03, 1.46e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.161. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT2/3_Dp2Yey and ECT2/3_WT is 2.14e+02 [95%CI -4e+02, 8.23e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.542. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT5_Dp2Yey and ECT5_WT is 5.62 [95%CI -5.06e+02, 5.14e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.985. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT6a_Dp2Yey and ECT6a_WT is 1.4e+02 [95%CI -7.7e+02, 1.35e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.807. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
