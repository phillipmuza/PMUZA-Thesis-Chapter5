The unpaired mean difference between PH_Dp2Yey and PH_WT is 2.19e+02 [95%CI -3.33e+02, 8.86e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.543. 

The unpaired mean difference between VMH_Dp2Yey and VMH_WT is -26.8 [95%CI -2.49e+02, 2.59e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.83. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
