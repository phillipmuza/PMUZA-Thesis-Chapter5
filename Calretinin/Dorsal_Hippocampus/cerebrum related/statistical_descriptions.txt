The unpaired mean difference between amc_Dp2Yey and amc_WT is -1.77e+02 [95%CI -5.74e+02, 4.43e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.524. 

The unpaired mean difference between cing_Dp2Yey and cing_WT is 75.6 [95%CI -3.34e+02, 5e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.74. 

The unpaired mean difference between st_Dp2Yey and st_WT is 15.6 [95%CI -2.95e+02, 3.79e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.93. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
