The unpaired mean difference between LH_Dp2Yey and LH_WT is -2.02e+02 [95%CI -6.46e+02, 1.43e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.369. 

The unpaired mean difference between MH_Dp2Yey and MH_WT is 1.7e+02 [95%CI -1.78e+02, 6.07e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.441. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
