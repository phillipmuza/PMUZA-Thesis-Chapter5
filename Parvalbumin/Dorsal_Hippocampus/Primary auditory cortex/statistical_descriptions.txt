The unpaired mean difference between AUDp1_Dp2Yey and AUDp1_WT is -5.42e+02 [95%CI -2.61e+03, 6.18e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.729. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDp2/3_Dp2Yey and AUDp2/3_WT is -3.01e+02 [95%CI -1.58e+03, 6.86e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.631. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
