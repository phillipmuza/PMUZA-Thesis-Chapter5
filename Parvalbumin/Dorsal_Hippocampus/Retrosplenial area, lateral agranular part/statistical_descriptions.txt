The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl1_Dp2Yey and RSPagl1_WT is -7.07e+02 [95%CI -1.63e+03, 1.43e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.185. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPagl2/3_WT is -2.97e+02 [95%CI -1.51e+03, 1.12e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.711. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl5_Dp2Yey and RSPagl5_WT is -9.33e+02 [95%CI -2.55e+03, 8.91e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.344. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl6a_Dp2Yey and RSPagl6a_WT is 1.28e+02 [95%CI -8.56e+02, 1.26e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.825. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
