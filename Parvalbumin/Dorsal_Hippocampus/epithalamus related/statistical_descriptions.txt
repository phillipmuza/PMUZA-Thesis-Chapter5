The unpaired mean difference between fr_Dp2Yey and fr_WT is 2.2e+02 [95%CI -2.16e+02, 4.81e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.256. 

The unpaired mean difference between hbc_Dp2Yey and hbc_WT is -3.27e+02 [95%CI -1.12e+03, 2.44e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.682. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
