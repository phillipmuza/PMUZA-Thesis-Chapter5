The unpaired mean difference between ECT1_Dp2Yey and ECT1_WT is -6.25e+02 [95%CI -1.42e+03, 7.34e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.332. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT2/3_Dp2Yey and ECT2/3_WT is -1.26e+03 [95%CI -2.32e+03, -1.61e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.066. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT5_Dp2Yey and ECT5_WT is 1.84e+02 [95%CI -1.21e+03, 1.28e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.777. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT6a_Dp2Yey and ECT6a_WT is 2.72e+02 [95%CI -7.63e+02, 1.09e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.63. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
