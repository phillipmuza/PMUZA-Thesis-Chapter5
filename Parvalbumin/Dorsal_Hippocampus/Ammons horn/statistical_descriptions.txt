The unpaired mean difference between CA1_Dp2Yey and CA1_WT is 61.0 [95%CI -2.89e+02, 6.12e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.804. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA2_Dp2Yey and CA2_WT is 2.41e+02 [95%CI -2.24e+02, 6.24e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.319. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA3_Dp2Yey and CA3_WT is -1.99 [95%CI -3.71e+02, 3.61e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.991. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
