The unpaired mean difference between RSPv1_Dp2Yey and RSPv1_WT is -1.4e+02 [95%CI -3.5e+02, 48.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.234. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPv2/3_WT is -2.66e+02 [95%CI -1.45e+03, 1.13e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.765. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv5_Dp2Yey and RSPv5_WT is -8.36e+02 [95%CI -2.75e+03, 1.08e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.436. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv6a_Dp2Yey and RSPv6a_WT is 3.96e+02 [95%CI -7.81e+02, 1.71e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.596. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
