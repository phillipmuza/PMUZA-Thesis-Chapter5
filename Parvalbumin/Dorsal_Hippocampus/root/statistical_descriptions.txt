The unpaired mean difference between VS_Dp2Yey and VS_WT is -1.5e+02 [95%CI -6.44e+02, 4.13e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.606. 

The unpaired mean difference between fiber tracts_Dp2Yey and fiber tracts_WT is 7.64 [95%CI -4.11e+02, 4e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.973. 

The unpaired mean difference between grey_Dp2Yey and grey_WT is 5.4e+02 [95%CI -3.06e+02, 1.43e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.233. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
