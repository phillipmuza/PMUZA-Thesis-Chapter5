=============
             
Good afternoon!

The unpaired mean difference between VPL_Dp2Yey and VPL_WT is -6.7e+02 [95%CI -2.2e+03, -94.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.313. 

The unpaired mean difference between VPM_Dp2Yey and VPM_WT is -1.16e+02 [95%CI -2.04e+02, -20.7].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0946. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
