The unpaired mean difference between DG-mo_Dp2Yey and DG-mo_WT is -49.6 [95%CI -2.64e+02, 1.29e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.711. 

The unpaired mean difference between DG-po_Dp2Yey and DG-po_WT is 91.8 [95%CI -7.86e+02, 7.22e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.893. 

The unpaired mean difference between DG-sg_Dp2Yey and DG-sg_WT is 63.1 [95%CI -6.5e+02, 7.44e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.863. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
