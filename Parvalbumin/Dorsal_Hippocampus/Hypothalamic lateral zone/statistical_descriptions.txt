The unpaired mean difference between LHA_Dp2Yey and LHA_WT is -1.19e+02 [95%CI -4.34e+02, 1.82e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.504. 

The unpaired mean difference between RCH_Dp2Yey and RCH_WT is -68.0 [95%CI -6.66e+02, 5.44e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.861. 

The unpaired mean difference between TU_Dp2Yey and TU_WT is -6.48e+02 [95%CI -1.54e+03, 2.16e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.176. 

The unpaired mean difference between ZI_Dp2Yey and ZI_WT is -5.6e+02 [95%CI -1.33e+03, 1e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.223. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
