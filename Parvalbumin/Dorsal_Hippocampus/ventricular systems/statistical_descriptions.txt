The unpaired mean difference between V3_Dp2Yey and V3_WT is -3.45e+02 [95%CI -7.08e+02, 47.7].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.131. 

The unpaired mean difference between VL_Dp2Yey and VL_WT is 1.3e+02 [95%CI -5.52e+02, 7.52e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.721. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
