The unpaired mean difference between COAa_Dp2Yey and COAa_WT is -4.62e+02 [95%CI -1.11e+03, 1.5e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.205. 

The unpaired mean difference between COAp_Dp2Yey and COAp_WT is -3.33e+02 [95%CI -7.81e+02, 2.11e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.256. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
