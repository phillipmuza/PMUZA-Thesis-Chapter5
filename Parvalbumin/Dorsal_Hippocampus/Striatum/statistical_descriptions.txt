The unpaired mean difference between sAMY_Dp2Yey and sAMY_WT is -3.52e+02 [95%CI -7.89e+02, 23.6].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.206. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
