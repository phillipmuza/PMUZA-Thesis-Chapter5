The unpaired mean difference between PERI1_Dp2Yey and PERI1_WT is -1.18e+02 [95%CI -6.36e+02, 3.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.669. 

The unpaired mean difference between PERI2/3_Dp2Yey and PERI2/3_WT is -1.67e+03 [95%CI -3.2e+03, -5.86e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.034. 

The unpaired mean difference between PERI5_Dp2Yey and PERI5_WT is -6.99e+02 [95%CI -2.75e+03, 3.51e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.448. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
