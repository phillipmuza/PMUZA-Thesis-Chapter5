The unpaired mean difference between LP_Dp2Yey and LP_WT is -2.9e+02 [95%CI -5.12e+02, 40.4].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0802. 

The unpaired mean difference between PO_Dp2Yey and PO_WT is 57.8 [95%CI -53.0, 2.65e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.626. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
