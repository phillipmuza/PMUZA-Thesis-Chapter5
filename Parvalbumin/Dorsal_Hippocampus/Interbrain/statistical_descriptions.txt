The unpaired mean difference between HY_Dp2Yey and HY_WT is -2.02e+02 [95%CI -5.32e+02, 77.6].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.262. 

The unpaired mean difference between TH_Dp2Yey and TH_WT is -28.0 [95%CI -1.27e+02, 82.4].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.624. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
