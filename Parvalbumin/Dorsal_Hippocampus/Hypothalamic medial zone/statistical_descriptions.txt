The unpaired mean difference between AHN_Dp2Yey and AHN_WT is -2.55e+02 [95%CI -1.54e+03, 2.9e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.955. 

The unpaired mean difference between VMH_Dp2Yey and VMH_WT is 3.31e+02 [95%CI -73.1, 7.35e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.19. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
