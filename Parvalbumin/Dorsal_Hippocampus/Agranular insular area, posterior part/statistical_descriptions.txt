The unpaired mean difference between AIp1_Dp2Yey and AIp1_WT is -3.06e+02 [95%CI -6.34e+02, -4.18].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.116. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp2/3_Dp2Yey and AIp2/3_WT is -9.6e+02 [95%CI -2.01e+03, -1.6e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0874. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp5_Dp2Yey and AIp5_WT is -4.2e+02 [95%CI -1.35e+03, 3.56e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.396. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp6a_Dp2Yey and AIp6a_WT is -19.0 [95%CI -6.44e+02, 7.07e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.971. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
