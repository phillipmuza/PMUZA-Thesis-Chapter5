The unpaired mean difference between RSPd1_Dp2Yey and RSPd1_WT is -82.2 [95%CI -5.11e+02, 3.79e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.733. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPd2/3_WT is -4.92e+02 [95%CI -2.13e+03, 1.28e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.605. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd5_Dp2Yey and RSPd5_WT is -1.69e+03 [95%CI -3.48e+03, 2.59e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.118. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd6a_Dp2Yey and RSPd6a_WT is -10.9 [95%CI -1.07e+03, 1.22e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.987. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
