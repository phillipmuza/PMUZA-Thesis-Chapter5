The unpaired mean difference between amc_Dp2Yey and amc_WT is 2.47e+02 [95%CI -6e+02, 7.34e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.637. 

The unpaired mean difference between cing_Dp2Yey and cing_WT is 6.06e+02 [95%CI -95.8, 2.34e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.341. 

The unpaired mean difference between st_Dp2Yey and st_WT is 2.24e+02 [95%CI 46.4, 4.66e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0578. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
