The unpaired mean difference between PAA_Dp2Yey and PAA_WT is -7.31e+02 [95%CI -1.16e+03, -2.92e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.009. 

The unpaired mean difference between PIR_Dp2Yey and PIR_WT is -3.24e+02 [95%CI -1.15e+03, 1.53e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.429. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
