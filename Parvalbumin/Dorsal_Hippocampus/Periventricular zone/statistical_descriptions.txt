The unpaired mean difference between ARH_Dp2Yey and ARH_WT is 5.45e+02 [95%CI 1.84e+02, 8.9e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0318. 

The unpaired mean difference between PVH_Dp2Yey and PVH_WT is 1.34e+02 [95%CI -8.07e+02, 6.82e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.788. 

The unpaired mean difference between PVi_Dp2Yey and PVi_WT is 37.9 [95%CI -5.3e+02, 4.52e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.894. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
