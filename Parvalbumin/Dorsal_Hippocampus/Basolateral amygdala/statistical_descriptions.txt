The unpaired mean difference between BLAa_Dp2Yey and BLAa_WT is 15.0 [95%CI -4.82e+02, 4.05e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.964. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAp_Dp2Yey and BLAp_WT is 1.55e+02 [95%CI -1.33e+03, 1.05e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.838. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAv_Dp2Yey and BLAv_WT is -7.53e+02 [95%CI -3.45e+03, 6.79e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.642. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
