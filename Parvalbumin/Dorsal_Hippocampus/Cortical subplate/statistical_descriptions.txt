The unpaired mean difference between BMA_Dp2Yey and BMA_WT is -3.51e+02 [95%CI -9.86e+02, -30.1].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.15. 

The unpaired mean difference between CLA_Dp2Yey and CLA_WT is -62.5 [95%CI -6.87e+02, 2.72e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.984. 

The unpaired mean difference between LA_Dp2Yey and LA_WT is -65.5 [95%CI -6.49e+02, 5.64e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.811. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
