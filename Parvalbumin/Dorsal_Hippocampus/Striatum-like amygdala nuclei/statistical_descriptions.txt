The unpaired mean difference between BA_Dp2Yey and BA_WT is -4.16e+02 [95%CI -1.5e+03, 8.81e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.519. 

The unpaired mean difference between CEA_Dp2Yey and CEA_WT is -3.22e+02 [95%CI -6.89e+02, 74.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.169. 

The unpaired mean difference between IA_Dp2Yey and IA_WT is -3.64e+02 [95%CI -1.09e+03, 1.88e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.534. 

The unpaired mean difference between MEA_Dp2Yey and MEA_WT is -2.51e+02 [95%CI -4.95e+02, -21.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0976. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
