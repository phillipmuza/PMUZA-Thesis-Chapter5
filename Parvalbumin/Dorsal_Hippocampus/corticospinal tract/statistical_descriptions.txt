Good afternoon!

The unpaired mean difference between int_Dp2Yey and int_WT is -1.28e+02 [95%CI -7.77e+02, 3.86e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.721. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
