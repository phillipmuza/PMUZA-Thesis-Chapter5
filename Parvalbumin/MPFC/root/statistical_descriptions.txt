Good evening!

The unpaired mean difference between fiber tracts_Dp2Yey and fiber tracts_WT is -3.98e+02 [95%CI -4.29e+03, 2.13e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.86. 

The unpaired mean difference between grey_Dp2Yey and grey_WT is -4.5e+02 [95%CI -1.59e+03, 7.03e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.494. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
