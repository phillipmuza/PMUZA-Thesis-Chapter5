The unpaired mean difference between ORBl1_Dp2Yey and ORBl1_WT is 3.85e+02 [95%CI -1.03e+03, 1.79e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.654. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBl2/3_WT is 1.53e+03 [95%CI 1.42e+02, 2.9e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0706. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl5_Dp2Yey and ORBl5_WT is 1.52e+03 [95%CI -1.11e+02, 3.27e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.12. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6a_Dp2Yey and ORBl6a_WT is 2e+03 [95%CI 3.19e+02, 4e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0832. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6b_Dp2Yey and ORBl6b_WT is 2.21e+03 [95%CI 8.51e+02, 4.29e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0252. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
