The unpaired mean difference between ACB_Dp2Yey and ACB_WT is 6.62e+02 [95%CI -1.42e+03, 3.25e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.621. 

The unpaired mean difference between OT_Dp2Yey and OT_WT is -1.6e+02 [95%CI -6.92e+02, 4.33e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.604. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
