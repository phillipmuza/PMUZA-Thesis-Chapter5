The unpaired mean difference between MOp1_Dp2Yey and MOp1_WT is 40.2 [95%CI -1.13e+03, 1.41e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.963. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp2/3_Dp2Yey and MOp2/3_WT is 1.39e+03 [95%CI 3.92e+02, 2.63e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0424. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp5_Dp2Yey and MOp5_WT is 1.1e+03 [95%CI -50.7, 2.61e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.177. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp6a_Dp2Yey and MOp6a_WT is 1.92e+03 [95%CI 4.22e+02, 3.73e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.056. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
