The unpaired mean difference between AON_Dp2Yey and AON_WT is 1.07e+03 [95%CI -3.57e+02, 2.24e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.173. 

The unpaired mean difference between DP_Dp2Yey and DP_WT is 8.49e+02 [95%CI -1.31e+02, 2.72e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.302. 

The unpaired mean difference between PIR_Dp2Yey and PIR_WT is 9.56e+02 [95%CI 2.95e+02, 1.66e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0282. 

The unpaired mean difference between TT_Dp2Yey and TT_WT is 8.47e+02 [95%CI -2.75e+02, 2.14e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.239. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
