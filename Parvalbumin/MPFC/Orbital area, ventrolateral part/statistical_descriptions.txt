The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBvl2/3_WT is 1.55e+03 [95%CI -9.32e+02, 4.28e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.327. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl5_Dp2Yey and ORBvl5_WT is 3.19e+02 [95%CI -1.03e+03, 1.77e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.678. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl6a_Dp2Yey and ORBvl6a_WT is 2.65e+03 [95%CI 6.73e+02, 5.1e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0542. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBvl6b_Dp2Yey and ORBvl6b_WT is 3.02e+03 [95%CI 7.03e+02, 7.55e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.234. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
