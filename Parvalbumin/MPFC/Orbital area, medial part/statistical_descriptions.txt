The unpaired mean difference between ORBm1_Dp2Yey and ORBm1_WT is 2.15e+03 [95%CI 1.37e+03, 2.94e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBm2/3_WT is 2e+03 [95%CI 7.56e+02, 3.02e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0474. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm5_Dp2Yey and ORBm5_WT is 1.33e+03 [95%CI -4.43e+02, 3.55e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.25. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBm6a_Dp2Yey and ORBm6a_WT is 3.02e+03 [95%CI 1.59e+03, 5.33e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0002. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
