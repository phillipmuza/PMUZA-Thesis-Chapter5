The unpaired mean difference between ACAd1_Dp2Yey and ACAd1_WT is 1.65e+03 [95%CI 8.05e+02, 3.2e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0022. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd2/3_Dp2Yey and ACAd2/3_WT is 2.41e+03 [95%CI 1.18e+03, 4.12e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.003. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd5_Dp2Yey and ACAd5_WT is 1.22e+03 [95%CI 2.36e+02, 2.27e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0502. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAd6a_Dp2Yey and ACAd6a_WT is 2.63e+03 [95%CI 1.44e+03, 3.8e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0054. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
