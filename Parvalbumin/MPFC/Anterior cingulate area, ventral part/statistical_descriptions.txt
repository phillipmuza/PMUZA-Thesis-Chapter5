The unpaired mean difference between ACAv1_Dp2Yey and ACAv1_WT is -3.02e+02 [95%CI -2.2e+03, 2.84e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.883. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAv2/3_Dp2Yey and ACAv2/3_WT is -1.09e+03 [95%CI -2.44e+03, 6.79e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.274. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAv5_Dp2Yey and ACAv5_WT is -5.88e+02 [95%CI -1.97e+03, 1.08e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.519. 

The unpaired mean difference between ACAv6a_Dp2Yey and ACAv6a_WT is -2.16e+03 [95%CI -4.22e+03, -4.03e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.148. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
