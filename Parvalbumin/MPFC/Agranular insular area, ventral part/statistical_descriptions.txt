The unpaired mean difference between AIv1_Dp2Yey and AIv1_WT is 2.46e+02 [95%CI -4.1e+02, 9.94e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.535. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv2/3_Dp2Yey and AIv2/3_WT is 64.8 [95%CI -8.47e+02, 1.12e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.909. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv5_Dp2Yey and AIv5_WT is 9.61e+02 [95%CI -3.11e+02, 2.31e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.225. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv6a_Dp2Yey and AIv6a_WT is 4.62e+02 [95%CI -1.28e+03, 2.66e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.676. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
