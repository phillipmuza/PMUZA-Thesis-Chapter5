The unpaired mean difference between AIv1_Dp2Yey and AIv1_WT is -7.07e+02 [95%CI -2.63e+03, 1.07e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.493. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv2/3_Dp2Yey and AIv2/3_WT is -1.59e+03 [95%CI -3.39e+03, 4.09e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.172. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIv5_Dp2Yey and AIv5_WT is -5.97e+02 [95%CI -1.89e+03, 7.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.424. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
