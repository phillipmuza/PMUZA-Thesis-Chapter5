The unpaired mean difference between AON_Dp2Yey and AON_WT is -1.17e+03 [95%CI -2.3e+03, -21.4].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0816. 

The unpaired mean difference between DP_Dp2Yey and DP_WT is -1.95e+03 [95%CI -3.85e+03, -2.33e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0726. 

The unpaired mean difference between PIR_Dp2Yey and PIR_WT is -1.47e+03 [95%CI -2.97e+03, -1.17e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0828. 

The unpaired mean difference between TT_Dp2Yey and TT_WT is -1.72e+03 [95%CI -3.27e+03, -1.75e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.061. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
