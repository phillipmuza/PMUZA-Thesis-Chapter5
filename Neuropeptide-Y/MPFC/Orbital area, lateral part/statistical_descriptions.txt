The unpaired mean difference between ORBl2/3_Dp2Yey and ORBl2/3_WT is -3.07e+03 [95%CI -4.94e+03, -9.59e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.232. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl5_Dp2Yey and ORBl5_WT is -1.55e+03 [95%CI -2.74e+03, -5.04].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0658. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6a_Dp2Yey and ORBl6a_WT is -1.46e+02 [95%CI -1.06e+03, 2.01e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.873. 

The unpaired mean difference between ORBl6b_Dp2Yey and ORBl6b_WT is 1.03e+02 [95%CI -8.56e+02, 1.57e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.905. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
