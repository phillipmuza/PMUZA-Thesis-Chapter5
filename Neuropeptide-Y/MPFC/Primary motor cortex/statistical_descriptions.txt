The unpaired mean difference between MOp1_Dp2Yey and MOp1_WT is 9.41e+02 [95%CI -1e+03, 2.49e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.316. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp2/3_Dp2Yey and MOp2/3_WT is -2.79e+03 [95%CI -3.61e+03, -1.8e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0004. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp5_Dp2Yey and MOp5_WT is -1.44e+03 [95%CI -2.18e+03, -6.2e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0088. 

The unpaired mean difference between MOp6a_Dp2Yey and MOp6a_WT is -5.78e+02 [95%CI -1.04e+03, 3.97].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0964. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
