The unpaired mean difference between GU1_Dp2Yey and GU1_WT is 1.65e+03 [95%CI -8.87e+02, 4.07e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.272. 

The unpaired mean difference between GU2/3_Dp2Yey and GU2/3_WT is -1.51e+03 [95%CI -3.5e+03, 3.57e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.307. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
