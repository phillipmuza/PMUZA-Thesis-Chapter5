The unpaired mean difference between AId1_Dp2Yey and AId1_WT is -1.05e+03 [95%CI -3.15e+03, 9.83e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.378. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId2/3_Dp2Yey and AId2/3_WT is -1.98e+03 [95%CI -4.33e+03, 4.92e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.194. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId5_Dp2Yey and AId5_WT is -1.53e+03 [95%CI -3.54e+03, -96.7].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.125. 

The unpaired mean difference between AId6a_Dp2Yey and AId6a_WT is -9.73e+02 [95%CI -2e+03, 1.21e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.119. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
