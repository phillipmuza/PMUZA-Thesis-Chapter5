The unpaired mean difference between VISam1_Dp2Yey and VISam1_WT is 2.74e+02 [95%CI -6.92e+02, 1.48e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.689. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISam2/3_Dp2Yey and VISam2/3_WT is 1.95e+02 [95%CI -3.87e+02, 9.02e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.609. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISam5_Dp2Yey and VISam5_WT is 2.06e+02 [95%CI -59.0, 5.52e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.288. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISam6a_Dp2Yey and VISam6a_WT is 4.18e+02 [95%CI -2.08e+02, 8.22e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.167. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
