The unpaired mean difference between RSPd1_Dp2Yey and RSPd1_WT is 99.9 [95%CI -9.95e+02, 9.11e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.853. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPd2/3_WT is -99.8 [95%CI -7.23e+02, 6.5e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.789. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd5_Dp2Yey and RSPd5_WT is 59.6 [95%CI -62.5, 2.19e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.493. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPd6a_Dp2Yey and RSPd6a_WT is 2.14 [95%CI -2.04e+02, 1.83e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.981. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
