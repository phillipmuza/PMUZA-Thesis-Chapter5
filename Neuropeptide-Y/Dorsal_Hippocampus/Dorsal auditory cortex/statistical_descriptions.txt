The unpaired mean difference between AUDd1_Dp2Yey and AUDd1_WT is 3.63e+02 [95%CI -1.17e+03, 2.08e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.72. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDd2/3_Dp2Yey and AUDd2/3_WT is 3.25e+02 [95%CI -3.29e+02, 1.26e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.504. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDd4_Dp2Yey and AUDd4_WT is 1.65e+02 [95%CI -2.62e+02, 5.72e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.494. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDd5_Dp2Yey and AUDd5_WT is -38.1 [95%CI -2.16e+02, 92.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.66. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDd6a_Dp2Yey and AUDd6a_WT is 39.2 [95%CI -1.1e+02, 1.95e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.63. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
