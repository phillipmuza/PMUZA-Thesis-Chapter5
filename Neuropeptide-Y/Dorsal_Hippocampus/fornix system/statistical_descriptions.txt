=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Tue Oct 11 13:51:11 2022.

The unpaired mean difference between alv_Dp2Yey and alv_WT is -38.2 [95%CI -1.54e+02, 96.9].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.574. 

The unpaired mean difference between fi_Dp2Yey and fi_WT is -1.17e+02 [95%CI -2.78e+02, 1.23e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.317. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
