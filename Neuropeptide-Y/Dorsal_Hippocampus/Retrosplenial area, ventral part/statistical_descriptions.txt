The unpaired mean difference between RSPv1_Dp2Yey and RSPv1_WT is -3.54 [95%CI -3.7e+02, 4.95e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.991. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPv2/3_WT is -7.71 [95%CI -4.28e+02, 4.13e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.976. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv5_Dp2Yey and RSPv5_WT is -27.5 [95%CI -2.39e+02, 1.18e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.778. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPv6a_Dp2Yey and RSPv6a_WT is -16.4 [95%CI -1.76e+02, 1.46e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.899. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
