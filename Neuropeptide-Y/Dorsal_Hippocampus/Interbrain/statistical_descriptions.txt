The unpaired mean difference between HY_Dp2Yey and HY_WT is -2.24e+02 [95%CI -6.85e+02, 2.69e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.418. 

The unpaired mean difference between TH_Dp2Yey and TH_WT is -1.27e+02 [95%CI -3.55e+02, 84.5].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.292. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
