The unpaired mean difference between CA1_Dp2Yey and CA1_WT is -62.6 [95%CI -2.23e+02, 1.03e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.473. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA2_Dp2Yey and CA2_WT is 16.2 [95%CI -97.4, 1.8e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.859. 

The unpaired mean difference between CA3_Dp2Yey and CA3_WT is -65.8 [95%CI -2.2e+02, 1.23e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.493. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
