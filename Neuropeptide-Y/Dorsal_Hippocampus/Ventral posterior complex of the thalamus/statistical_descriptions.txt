=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Tue Oct 11 13:50:21 2022.

The unpaired mean difference between VPM_Dp2Yey and VPM_WT is 0.555 [95%CI -5.29, 4.58].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.8. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
