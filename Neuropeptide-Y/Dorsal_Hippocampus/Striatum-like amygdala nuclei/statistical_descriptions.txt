The unpaired mean difference between BA_Dp2Yey and BA_WT is -4.8e+02 [95%CI -1.66e+03, 3.55e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.535. 

The unpaired mean difference between CEA_Dp2Yey and CEA_WT is -3.94e+02 [95%CI -1.47e+03, 5.38e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.474. 

The unpaired mean difference between IA_Dp2Yey and IA_WT is -4.08e+02 [95%CI -1.04e+03, 5.55e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.379. 

The unpaired mean difference between MEA_Dp2Yey and MEA_WT is -2.05e+02 [95%CI -1.15e+03, 3.99e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.613. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
