The unpaired mean difference between V3_Dp2Yey and V3_WT is -6.16e+02 [95%CI -1.44e+03, 1.89e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.162. 

The unpaired mean difference between VL_Dp2Yey and VL_WT is -4.51e+02 [95%CI -1.07e+03, 2.96e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.243. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
