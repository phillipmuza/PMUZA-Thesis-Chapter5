The unpaired mean difference between BMA_Dp2Yey and BMA_WT is 48.1 [95%CI -4.48e+02, 7e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.899. 

The unpaired mean difference between LA_Dp2Yey and LA_WT is -44.5 [95%CI -4.67e+02, 2.84e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.796. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
