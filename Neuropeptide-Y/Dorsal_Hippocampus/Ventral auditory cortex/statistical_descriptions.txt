The unpaired mean difference between AUDv1_Dp2Yey and AUDv1_WT is 4.11e+02 [95%CI -9.04e+02, 2.11e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.636. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDv2/3_Dp2Yey and AUDv2/3_WT is 4.23e+02 [95%CI -8.37e+02, 2.12e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.638. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDv4_Dp2Yey and AUDv4_WT is 3.72e+02 [95%CI -2.06e+02, 1.04e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.349. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDv5_Dp2Yey and AUDv5_WT is -52.6 [95%CI -2.01e+02, 76.7].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.514. 

The unpaired mean difference between AUDv6a_Dp2Yey and AUDv6a_WT is -27.2 [95%CI -2.67e+02, 1.16e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.804. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
