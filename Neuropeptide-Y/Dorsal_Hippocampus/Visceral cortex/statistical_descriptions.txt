The unpaired mean difference between VISC1_Dp2Yey and VISC1_WT is -47.1 [95%CI -1.61e+03, 1.71e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.956. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISC2/3_Dp2Yey and VISC2/3_WT is 77.7 [95%CI -1.31e+03, 1.36e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.922. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISC5_Dp2Yey and VISC5_WT is -1.27e+02 [95%CI -4.36e+02, 76.3].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.387. 

The unpaired mean difference between VISC6a_Dp2Yey and VISC6a_WT is -1.25e+02 [95%CI -4.63e+02, 52.8].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.624. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
