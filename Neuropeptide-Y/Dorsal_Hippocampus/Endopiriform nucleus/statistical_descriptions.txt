=============
             
Good afternoon!

The unpaired mean difference between EPd_Dp2Yey and EPd_WT is -1.62e+02 [95%CI -4.42e+02, 79.3].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.253. 

The unpaired mean difference between EPv_Dp2Yey and EPv_WT is 1.47e+02 [95%CI -3.65e+02, 6.54e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.651. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
