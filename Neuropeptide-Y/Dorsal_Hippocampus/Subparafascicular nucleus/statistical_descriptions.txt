=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Tue Oct 11 13:49:55 2022.

The unpaired mean difference between SPFm_Dp2Yey and SPFm_WT is -1.18e+03 [95%CI -2.4e+03, -4.95e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
