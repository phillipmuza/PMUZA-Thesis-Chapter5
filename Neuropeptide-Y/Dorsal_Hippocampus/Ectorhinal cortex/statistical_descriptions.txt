The unpaired mean difference between ECT1_Dp2Yey and ECT1_WT is 61.9 [95%CI -1.55e+03, 1.96e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.95. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT2/3_Dp2Yey and ECT2/3_WT is 73.9 [95%CI -1.18e+03, 9.53e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.899. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT5_Dp2Yey and ECT5_WT is -1.3e+02 [95%CI -7.83e+02, 2.38e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.851. 

The unpaired mean difference between ECT6a_Dp2Yey and ECT6a_WT is -4.19e+02 [95%CI -7.59e+02, -83.6].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.0088. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
