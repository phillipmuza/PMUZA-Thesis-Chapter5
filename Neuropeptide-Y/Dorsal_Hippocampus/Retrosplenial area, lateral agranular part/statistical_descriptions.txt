The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl1_Dp2Yey and RSPagl1_WT is 65.4 [95%CI -8.03e+02, 9.19e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.904. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl2/3_Dp2Yey and RSPagl2/3_WT is -72.4 [95%CI -5.73e+02, 4.41e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.799. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl5_Dp2Yey and RSPagl5_WT is 19.3 [95%CI -1.82e+02, 2.48e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.888. 

The unpaired mean difference between RSPagl6a_Dp2Yey and RSPagl6a_WT is 83.9 [95%CI -1.36e+02, 3.08e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.541. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
