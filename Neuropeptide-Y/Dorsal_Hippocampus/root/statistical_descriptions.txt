Good afternoon!

The unpaired mean difference between VS_Dp2Yey and VS_WT is -2.44e+02 [95%CI -1.56e+03, 1.19e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.797. 

The unpaired mean difference between fiber tracts_Dp2Yey and fiber tracts_WT is -1.24e+02 [95%CI -3.99e+02, 1.94e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.449. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
