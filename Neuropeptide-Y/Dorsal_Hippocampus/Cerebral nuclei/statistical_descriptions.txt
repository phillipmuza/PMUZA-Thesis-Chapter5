=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Tue Oct 11 13:50:09 2022.

The unpaired mean difference between PAL_Dp2Yey and PAL_WT is -65.6 [95%CI -4.65e+02, 2.26e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.502. 

The unpaired mean difference between STR_Dp2Yey and STR_WT is -2.07e+02 [95%CI -7.2e+02, 2.56e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.451. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
