The unpaired mean difference between AHN_Dp2Yey and AHN_WT is -1.65e+02 [95%CI -7.13e+02, 1.84e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.538. 

The unpaired mean difference between PH_Dp2Yey and PH_WT is -1.56e+02 [95%CI -1.09e+03, 8.02e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.762. 

The unpaired mean difference between PMd_Dp2Yey and PMd_WT is -98.6 [95%CI -1.86e+03, 1.76e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.864. 

The unpaired mean difference between VMH_Dp2Yey and VMH_WT is 3.66e+02 [95%CI -4.01e+02, 1.47e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.524. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
