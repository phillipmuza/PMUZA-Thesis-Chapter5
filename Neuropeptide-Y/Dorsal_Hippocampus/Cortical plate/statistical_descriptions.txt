=============
             
Good afternoon!

The unpaired mean difference between HPF_Dp2Yey and HPF_WT is 4.31e+02 [95%CI -5.12e+02, 1.74e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.61. 

The unpaired mean difference between OLF_Dp2Yey and OLF_WT is 62.3 [95%CI -6.08e+02, 1.16e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.929. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
