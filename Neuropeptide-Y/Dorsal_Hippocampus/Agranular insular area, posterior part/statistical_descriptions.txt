The unpaired mean difference between AIp1_Dp2Yey and AIp1_WT is 2.06e+02 [95%CI -9.44e+02, 1.79e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.815. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp2/3_Dp2Yey and AIp2/3_WT is 2.41e+02 [95%CI -2.35e+02, 1.01e+03].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.605. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp5_Dp2Yey and AIp5_WT is -1.22e+02 [95%CI -4.49e+02, 2.15e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.521. 

The unpaired mean difference between AIp6a_Dp2Yey and AIp6a_WT is -1.41e+02 [95%CI -5.43e+02, 1.07e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.616. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
