The unpaired mean difference between BLAa_Dp2Yey and BLAa_WT is 82.3 [95%CI -89.2, 4.04e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.72. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAp_Dp2Yey and BLAp_WT is 2.59e+02 [95%CI 12.2, 7.35e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.31. 

The unpaired mean difference between BLAv_Dp2Yey and BLAv_WT is -83.3 [95%CI -6.52e+02, 5.13e+02].
The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.816. 

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.
For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.
